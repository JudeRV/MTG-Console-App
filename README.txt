IMPORTANT:

The MTG_App.exe file will not work to run this program. 
In order to run it:
- Open a Windows command prompt
- Change your directory to the folder that this README is in
    - This can be done by typing "cd", then the exact file path of the folder.
        - If this folder is in a drive other than C:, you'll have to switch to that drive before changing directories, simply by typing the letter of the drive followed by a colon, with no space in between.
- Type in the command "MTG_App [deck file name].txt"
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
If you'd like to run the program for a specific deck more easily:

- Create a new text document (.txt)
- Put the same text in the document as you would when running the program from the command line
- Save and close the document
- Rename the document in the folder as "[deck-name].bat"
- Click yes on the warning message
- You should be able to run the program for that specific deck by double-clicking on the .bat file you created. Keep in mind, you'll have to create different .bat files for each deck you have, and the deck text documents must be in the same folder.
